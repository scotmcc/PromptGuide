# PromptGuide

Welcome to **PromptGuide**, a comprehensive resource for designing and optimizing system prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide is intended to help developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts create more effective and tailored interactions with general-purpose LLMs like Mistral, LLaMA, and others.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed and structured approach to crafting system prompts. It will cover various aspects such as setting objectives, defining roles, determining tone and style, applying guidelines and constraints, and iterating based on feedback.

By consolidating best practices, examples, and insights, this guide aims to be the go-to resource for anyone looking to understand and utilize the power of prompt engineering effectively.
