# Establishing Guidelines and Constraints

## Why Establish Guidelines and Constraints?

Guidelines and constraints are essential for refining the behavior of an LLM and ensuring it operates within specific boundaries. By setting clear rules, you can prevent the AI from generating inappropriate content, maintain consistency in tone and style, and ensure that the responses align with the intended objectives. These controls help create a more predictable and reliable user experience.

## Types of Guidelines and Constraints

### 1. **Content Restrictions**

Content restrictions prevent the AI from discussing certain topics or using specific language. This is especially important for avoiding sensitive, controversial, or inappropriate content.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Avoid discussing political opinions."
    -   "Do not provide medical diagnoses or health advice."
    -   "Refrain from using offensive or profane language."
    -   "Do not generate content related to illegal activities."

### 2. **Behavioral Guidelines**

Behavioral guidelines dictate how the AI should interact with users, including the tone it should maintain and the type of language it should use.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Be polite and respectful in all responses."
    -   "Use neutral language and avoid making assumptions about the user."
    -   "Encourage user engagement by asking open-ended questions."
    -   "Avoid interrupting the user or providing unsolicited advice."

### 3. **Response Length Constraints**

Response length constraints help control how verbose or concise the AI's output should be, depending on the context and user needs.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Keep responses to a maximum of 150 words."
    -   "Provide brief, one-sentence answers unless further detail is requested."
    -   "Use detailed explanations for technical topics, with a minimum of 300 words."

### 4. **Formatting Requirements**

Formatting requirements dictate how the AI should structure its responses to enhance readability and comprehension.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Format answers in bullet points for clarity."
    -   "Use numbered steps for instructional content."
    -   "Include a summary at the end of long responses."
    -   "Use headings and subheadings to organize content."

### 5. **Ethical and Safety Constraints**

Ethical and safety constraints are designed to ensure the AI operates within ethical boundaries and promotes safe interactions.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Ensure all information provided is factual and verifiable."
    -   "Avoid biased or discriminatory language."
    -   "Respect user privacy and avoid collecting personal information."
    -   "Do not promote harmful or illegal activities."

### 6. **Knowledge Limitations**

Knowledge limitations help ensure the AI does not overstep its capabilities or provide inaccurate information outside its domain expertise.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Limit responses to information known up to 2021."
    -   "Provide a disclaimer when discussing speculative or emerging topics."
    -   "Stay within the AI's domain expertise; do not attempt to provide expert legal advice if not specified."

### 7. **Interactivity Levels**

Interactivity levels determine how actively the AI engages with the user, either prompting for more input or passively providing information.

-   _Examples_:
    -   "Actively seek user input to clarify questions or refine responses."
    -   "Provide interactive quizzes or challenges to engage the user."
    -   "Be passive in responses, only providing information when directly asked."
    -   "Avoid leading questions; focus on providing objective information."

## How to Establish Guidelines and Constraints

To set effective guidelines and constraints, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Potential Risks**: Consider what risks or issues might arise in the interaction and set constraints to mitigate them.
2. **Align with Objectives**: Ensure that all guidelines support the primary objectives set for the interaction.
3. **Be Specific and Clear**: Clearly define the guidelines to avoid ambiguity, ensuring the AI understands the boundaries of acceptable behavior.
4. **Test and Refine**: Continuously test the AI’s responses against the set guidelines and refine them as necessary based on feedback and observed behavior.

## Crafting Prompts with Guidelines and Constraints

When crafting your prompt, include specific guidelines and constraints to ensure the AI behaves as desired. Here’s a template you can use:

```plaintext
Your objective is to [Objective Type]. You should [Behavior or Action]. Ensure that your responses are [Tone and Style] and follow these guidelines: [List of Guidelines/Constraints].
```
